Short description (one line): Research-stage artificial gravity field modeling and experimental prototypes â€” see docs/ for validation artifacts.

Long description (for GitHub About): This repository contains exploratory research code, models, and experimental notes for artificial gravity field generation concepts. Results and performance metrics are preliminary and derived from simulation and controlled lab experiments; they are not production-ready. See docs/benchmarks.md and docs/UQ-notes.md for reproducibility materials, uncertainty quantification (UQ) details, and validation procedures. Maintain cautious external messaging and link to validation artifacts when publishing summaries.
