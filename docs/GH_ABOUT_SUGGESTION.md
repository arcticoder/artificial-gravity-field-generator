Suggested GitHub About (hedged)

Short description (suggested):

"This repository explores simulation and prototype tooling for generating localized artificial gravity fields in constrained laboratory settings. Results are model-derived and experimental; claims about performance are preliminary and should be interpreted with caution."

Scope, Validation & Limitations
- Scope: describes simulation code, test cases, and small-scale prototype concepts. Not a production-ready gravity generator.
- Validation: key simulation assumptions, numerical methods, and test-suite coverage are listed in the repository. Users should validate results against independent experiments and sensitivity analyses.
- Limitations: model outputs are sensitive to boundary conditions and material parameter choices; numerical convergence and uncertainty quantification (UQ) are incomplete.

Suggested maintainer action:
- Replace the repository About/description with the hedged text above or a shortened hedged variant.
- Link to reproducibility artifacts (simulation inputs, test results, and UQ notebooks) from the About page if available.

Pointers for UQ / Reproducibility (if present in repo):
- Look for notebooks or directories named `notebooks`, `uq`, `analysis`, `examples`, or `repro` and link them here.
- If you have CI test badges or a `docs/` site, include links to concrete evidence of passing tests and the relevant commit IDs.

- If you'd like help drafting a condensed About message, open an issue tagging @maintainers with a link to this file.
