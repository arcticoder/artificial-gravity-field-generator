## 1. Theoretical Foundation

### 1.1 LQG-Enhanced Gravitational Field Generation

The artificial gravity field generator operates on LQG-modified Einstein field equations:

```
G_μν + Λ_eff(ℓ)g_μν = (8πG/c⁴)T_μν^(enhanced)
```

Where the LQG-enhanced artificial gravity contribution includes polymer corrections:

```
T_μν^(artificial) = ρ_field u_μ u_ν + p_field g_μν + T_μν^(polymer)
```

### 1.2 Field Configuration Mathematics

#### Uniform Field Generation
For uniform artificial gravity fields:

```
g_artificial = g₀ ẑ
∇ × g_artificial = 0
∇ · g_artificial = 0
```

#### Gradient Field Control
Controlled gradient fields follow:

```
g(r) = g₀[1 + α(r - r₀)]
```

Where α is the gradient parameter (|α| < 10⁻³ m⁻¹ for safety).

### 1.3 Temporal Coherence Framework

The temporal coherence of artificial gravity fields follows T⁻⁴ scaling:

```
Coherence(t) = exp(-(t/τ)⁴)
```

Where τ is the coherence time scale, typically 100+ seconds for operational fields.
